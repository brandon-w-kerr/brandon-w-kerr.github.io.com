        <h1 class="justsomeheadertext spectral-regular FadeIn">More About Me!</h1>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">I'm a very empathetic person. My family has come from various backgrounds so I do not discriminate nor shame people for the way they want to live, as long as they aren't hurting other people.</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Video games have supported my life to the FULLEST DEGREE. My music taste, mannerisms and beliefs comes from various games. It would be too much to list all the games that I played on this site, so I put it on another! <br><link>https://www.backloggd.com/u/Derpzie/</link></p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">I love listening to music. I can listen to almost anything (not counting country) but my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Ken Carson, and Tyler, the Creator</p>
        <h2 class="justsomeheadertext spectral-regular FadeIn">Favorites</h2>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite Food: Chicken alfredo. Chicken alfredo is more of a recent addition.</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite TV show: "The Boys". I love shows with gore in them. Ironically, I don't like horror...</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite Anime: "Yu Yu Hakusho"! When I first watched it, it helped me realize that I really needed to take life seriously because one day could be my day, plus, it was really funny when I watched it.</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite Movie: "Ratatouille" If it wasn't for this film, this website wouldnt be here!</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite Coding Language: Python was the first that I used and it will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
        <p class="paragraphsummary FadeIn">Favorite Album: "To Pimp a Butterfly" by Kendrick Lamar. This album is amazing, while also being extremely dense. Its the first album to actually make me relisten to it to fully get the message. My favorite song off of the album is "Mortal Man".</p>
